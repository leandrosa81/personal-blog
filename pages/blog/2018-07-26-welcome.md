It took me over 20 years to start my first blog. Talk about procrastination.

Here in this blog, I will try to constrain my writings to subjects about programming and software architecture in general, but occasionally I will also write about life if it seems fit.

I should warn you that English is not my first language and unfortunately there will probably be some spell errors throughout these pages.
